# Introduction {#introduction}

Surveys are ubiquitous in data science. A clear example is a simple demographic form. Our package allows you to easily create questionnaires using Shiny.[^1] We provide two functions to do this: `surveyOutput()` and `renderSurvey()`. Both of these functions take in a data frame containing question information that follows a specific format. To illustrate them in use, we will show you a questionnaire from McGowan et al. (unpublished) that is built into the `shinysurveys` package:

[^1]: We assume that you are familiar with the basic layout of a Shiny application. If not, please check out RStudio's [great resources](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) before completing this vignette.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions
```

As seen, this is a tidy data frame, where each row is a unique observation and each column is a variable. While there are 54 rows, there are only 11 unique questions:

```{r display unique questions}
unique(shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions$question)
```

Each question has seven variables that dictate how it functions within the survey. They are described in the data set documentation, accessed by calling `?shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions` in your console, as follows:

-   *question*: The question to be asked.
-   *option*: A possible response to the question. In multiple choice questions, for example, this would be the possible answers. For questions without discrete answers, such as a numeric input, this would be the default option shown on the input.
-   *input_type*: What type of response is expected? Currently supported types include `numeric`, `mc` for multiple choice, `text`, `select`,and `y/n` for yes/no questions.
-   *input_id*: The input id for Shiny inputs.
-   *dependence*: Does this question (row) depend on another? That is, should it only appear if a different question has a specific value? This column contains the input_id of whatever question this one depends upon.
-   *dependence_value*: This column contains the specific value that the dependence question must take for this question (row) to be shown.
-   *required*: logical TRUE/FALSE signifying if a question is required.

# Examples

Below are examples of the currently supported question types. We provide a thorough explanation for the numeric input, but only point out notable differences for other inputs.

## Numeric Input

A good example of a numeric input is the first question: "What's your age?":

```{r what is your age preview, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "age")
```

As we noted in the [introduction](#Introduction), this row shows us that the question is "What's your age?". We know we are expecting a numeric input by looking at the `input_type` column, and the default value is equal to 25 according to the `option` column.[^2]

[^2]: It is important to note that the option column for numeric inputs provides the default value, but for other types -- as we will see -- provides the possible options for a question.

We can also tell that there are no dependency questions. This means that no matter what value you enter, no follow-up question will appear. Lastly, we know this is a required question.[^3]

[^3]: Required question functionality will be discussed in more detail in the section [Required Questions](#required_questions).

## Multiple Choice (mc) Input {#multiple_choice}

An example of this is the question "Which best describes your gender?":

```{r what is your gender mc, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "gender" | input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

Unlike numeric inputs, the `option` column represents each of the possible responses for this question. You may notice that the fifth row of this question has *NA* in the `option` column and "text" in the `input_type` column. We will discuss this in more detail [below](#Question%20Dependencies), but for now note that this question has a dependent. That is, if a specific option is chosen for this question, a new one will appear below. In this case, a question that accepts text as its input.

![](images/mc_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

## Text Input {#text_input}

Questions that need text-based input should specify "text" in the `input_type` column. As noted in the previous example, the following is a dependent of the question "Which best describes your gender?":

```{r what is your gender text, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

It's important to note that the `option` column for text-based inputs can be left blank (i.e. NA) or contain a character string. If they are left empty, the text field will display "Placeholder." Otherwise, the character string will be displayed:

![](images/text_input_placeholder.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![](images/text_input_character_string.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="290" height="71"}

## Select Input

Select inputs are great when there are many potential, discretely defined, response choices.[^4] An example is the question "What was your first language?" which contains `r nrow(subset(teaching_r_questions, question == "What was your first language?"))` 15 options (rows):[^5]

[^4]: As of October 2020, these do not support multiple options selected at once, though we anticipate adding this functionality in the future.

[^5]: Note the presence of the NA in the output above. This deals with question dependencies, which is explained in detail in the section [Dependency Questions](#Question%20Dependencies).

```{r show first language options, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, question == "What was your first language?")$option
```

![](images/select_input_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

## Yes or No (y/n) Input

Yes or no questions are self-explanatory. An example is the question "Have you ever learned to program in R?":

```{r learned to program in R, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "learned_r")
```

# Implementing Surveys in Shiny

## Main Functions

### UI Function

`surveyOutput()` takes in a data frame of the form described above. You may also add a title and description for your survey with the arguments `survey_title` and `survey_description`, though these are optional. Further documentation forcan be accessed by typing `?shinysurveys::surveyOutput()` in the console.

### Server Function

`renderSurvey()` takes in a data frame of the form described above. It also takes in the input, output, and session arguments that allow it to interface with the Shiny app. Lastly, it takes in a `theme` color to style your survey. Typical names such as "red" or "blue" work, as well as hex color codes such as "\#63B8FF" (the default theme). The documentation for it can be accessed by typing `?shinysurveys::renderSurvey()` in the console.

## Basic Survey

A minimal example of a survey can be created with this template:

```{r run survey, eval = FALSE}
library(shinysurveys)
ui <- shiny::fluidPage(
  shinysurveys::surveyOutput(df = shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions,
                             survey_title = "A minimal title",
                             survey_description = "A minimal description")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  shinysurveys::renderSurvey(df = shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions,
                             input = input, 
                             output = output,
                             session = session)
}

shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Please note that the UI comes with a "Submit" button included. Survey designers can customize actions by using the call `input$submit`. Some examples would be saving or displaying user responses. An example of that can be found [here](https://jdtrat-apps.shinyapps.io/shinysurveys_survey_submit).

## Advanced Features

### Dependency Questions

We use the term question dependencies in reference to the situations where a question should only be shown (i.e. asked) if a specific response is given to a preceding question. The questions included with the `shinysurveys` package contain many dependencies. One example we've seen discussing [multiple choice](#multiple_choice) and [text-based](#text_input) questions is the dependent for "Which best describes your gender?"

```{r what is your gender - question dependencies, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "gender" | input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

Focusing on the columns `dependence` and `dependence_value`, we see that the text-based question will only show if the multiple choice one, with the input id of "gender" takes on the value "Prefer to self describe." That is, a question with non *NA* values in the `dependence` and `dependence_value` columns mean that it will only show if the question with the input id from `dependence` takes on the value from `dependence_value`. This can be seen below:

![](images/dependency_example_2.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

### Required Questions {#required_questions}

Survey designers can define questions that must be answered by adding the value TRUE to the `required` column. If a required question is not answered, the user will not be able to submit their responses.

![](images/required_submit_enabled.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

### User Tracking

Built into the survey is the ability to track users based on URL parameters. If you deploy your survey on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io), or run it locally in a browser, you can add a URL parameter after the backslash as follows: `?user_id=12345`. A live demo can be found here: <https://jdtrat-apps.shinyapps.io/shinysurveys_survey_user_tracking/?user_id=hadley>
